My Portfolio for Data Analyst Position. This repository contains:
1. "Graph_Output(Visualization) in PNG" folder
-> This folder contains various graphic in PNG format. The graphic is the visualization of the data made using Matplotlib. The filename represents the question's number in which I was trying to answer using this visualization. Example: filename '1a & 1b' means that it's a graph for answering question number 1a and number 1b. The question is available on the first page of my portfolio either in ipynb format or pdf format. For convenience I'll also put the questions at the end of this README file.

2. "Portfolio_DataAnalysis.ipynb"
-> Contains my portfolio in Jupyter Notebook format. The portfolio demonstrates me analyzing a Netflix dataset. It starts with asking myself the question I needed answer from this dataset (what do I wanna know or infer from this dataset), continued by cleaning the dataset and ended with Exploratory Data Analysis along with its visualization. The cleaning and visualizing is both done using Python 3.0 language.

3. "Portfolio_DataAnalysis_L.pdf"
-> Contains my portfolio from Jupyter Notebook but in PDF format. The PDF format makes it easier to jump pages although you do have to download the file first if you want to be able to jump pages. Here is some key pages that you can quickly navigate to:
a. Questions can be found at page 1,
b. Data preprocessing (checking and cleaning data) starts at page 3,
c. EDA (Explorary Data Analysis) + Data Visualization starts at page 24.

4. "README.md"
-> This file. Contains information regarding this repository.

5. "SQLscript_NetflixDataVisualization.sql"
-> Contains SQL script. This script was made as if I were to answer question and visualize the data using SQL. I used the cleaned version of the data (cleaned with Python) and made queries for answering question presented in the portfolio.

Questions I need to answer from the presented Netflix dataset (same one from portfolio):
1. How does the amount of content on Netflix grow over the year? What year did Netflix add the most content on its platform? What is themost popular month for Netflix to add new content?

2.What type of content dominates the platform? What kind of genre dominates the most for each type? How does the duration of shows vary? Is there any correlation between duration and genre that dominates?

3.Which (maturity) rating has the most amount on both type of content? Does that reflects Netflix's target audience?

4.Which country has the most content?

5.Which actor/actress shows up most frequently? What about director? Which one shows up most frequently? Is there any correlationbetween the two (actor and director)? Which actor - director pairing shows up the most?
